                       "Linux interface rate monitor"

  For install, read the file "INSTALL"

  This is a "Hello word" clone. Please read copyright papers from "Kernigam
& Ritchie" ! Just kidding ...
  
  This is a simple program who read from /proc/net/dev and write some
real-time statistics about the trafic on interfaces. 
  You can use it free (and without waranties), i hope you will find it usefull
and you will use it only for moral .

  Known bugs: - some interface drivers have bugs in the update of the counter,
		not my fault...
	      - some drivers have time counters updated at more than 1 second
		interval, to have exact averages you must set an interval 
		much bigger than this interval (example: "./if_rate 10")


  Updates:
  2.0.0 
	- the rate is more accured, now I use gettimeofday() for exact time
	measuring.
	- more space for gigabit counters
	- accept argument - number of seconds between counters is settable
